# Storage settings holds together all storage settings.
# All settings for particular database engine (i.e, filepaths for BoltDB,
# endpoints and regions for DynamoDB etc.) are assumed to be the same across
# all storages. If they are not the same, the latest option in this file will be applied.
# For example, if there are two MongoDB-backed storages, appStorage and tokenStorage,
# and endpoint for appStorage is localhost:27017, while tokenStorage's endpoint is localhost:27018,
# server will connect both storages to localhost:27018.
